## Description

This playground repository adapts from the example in ANTLR's [Getting Started](https://github.com/antlr/antlr4/blob/master/doc/getting-started.md)
guide. It implements the ANTLR code-gen via a Gradle plugin and task. 

## Instructions

Follow these instructions to code-gen the parser, build the sample program and run it:

1. Use Java 17
2. Generate the ANTLR parser and build the program distribution:
   * `./gradlew install`
   * Notice the files in `src/main/java/dgroomes/antlr`. These are the result of ANTLR's code generation.
3. Create an alias to run the program:
   * `alias app="./app/build/install/app/bin/app"`
5. Run the program over an example `*.hello` file
   * `app "${PWD}/greet-friends.hello"`

## Wish list

General clean ups, TODOs and things I wish to implement for this project:

* Learn about [Gradle's built-in `antlr` task](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/antlr_plugin.html). It's not
  brilliantly documented so I had an easier time to just writing the Gradle code by-hand. But it would be more idiomatic
  to use Gradle's own plugin and tasks.
* Support multiple greetings. Right now, only `(greeting hello Demetrius)` shows up in the output but I want `(greeting hello Abigail)`
  etc.

## Reference

* [ANTLR docs](https://www.antlr.org/)
